# Lab 1: User and Group Management  

## Objective  
- Create a new group named `ivolve` and a new user assigned to this group with a secure password. Configure the userâ€™s permissions to allow installing Nginx with elevated privileges using the `sudo` tool (without requiring a password).  

## Steps  

## 1. Create a New Group  
Replace `ivolve` with the desired groupname.
```bash
sudo groupadd ivolve
```

## 2. Create a New User and Assign to the Group  
Replace `username` with the desired username.
```bash
sudo useradd -m -G ivolve -s /bin/bash <username>
```

id <username>
```

## 4. Grant Sudo Privileges Without Password Prompt
```bash
sudo visudo
```
or 
```bash
sudo vim /etc/sudoers
```
- Add the following line to give permission to the user to install only nginx
```
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt install nginx
```

## 5. Install Nginx with Sudo (No Password Prompt)
- Switch to the created user and start installing nginx
```bash
su - <username> 
```
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

- Try to install httpd
  It will not be allowed because the user has only the permission to install nginx

# I created a script to automate the process, eliminating the need to run each command manually.
