# DevOps Labs Collection

This repository is a comprehensive collection of DevOps labs designed to provide hands-on experience with various tools, technologies, and concepts including ***Linux***, ***Ansible***, ***AWS***, ***Terraform***, ***Jenkins***, ***Kubernetes***, and ***OpenShift***. 

Each lab demonstrates a specific use case, offering a practical approach to mastering DevOps engineering.

The labs are organized into directories based on the tools and technologies used, making it easy to navigate and focus on a specific area of expertise.

## Directory Overview 

### 1. Linux Labs

- Focused on foundational Linux skills, including scripting, package management, and server administration.

  Example Labs:
  - **Shell scripting to automate tasks.**
  - **Configuring and troubleshooting services like web servers.**
---
### 2. Ansible Labs

- Explores AWS infrastructure and services, using both the AWS Management Console and CLI.

  Labs include security configuration, EC2 instance management, VPC setup, and load balancer deployment.
  Example Labs:
  - **Creating IAM users, groups, and policies.**
  - **Launching EC2 instances in public and private subnets.**
  - **Configuring application load balancers for high availability.**
---
### 3. Terraform Labs

- Focuses on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to define and deploy multi-tier architectures, manage state files, and implement best practices like     modularization.

  Example Labs:
  - **Creating VPCs, subnets, and EC2 instances using Terraform.**
  - **Using Terraform modules and remote backends.**
  - **Managing lifecycle rules and importing existing resources.**
---
### 4. Jenkins Labs

- Covers Jenkins installation, pipeline creation, and automation of CI/CD workflows.

- Labs range from basic setup to advanced concepts like shared libraries and multibranch pipelines.

  Example Labs:
  - **Building Docker images and deploying applications to Kubernetes.**
  - **Creating pipelines for automated testing and deployment.**
  - **Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) in Jenkins.**
---
### 5. OpenShift Labs 

- Explores OpenShift features for managing Kubernetes clusters, focusing on application deployment, RBAC, and security.

- Labs highlight the differences between OpenShift and Kubernetes.

  Example Labs:
  - **Rolling updates and rollbacks for deployments.**
  - **Comparing Deployments and StatefulSets with examples.**
  - **Configuring RBAC for secure access and management.**
